## **📋 Project Context & Objectives**

**Epic:** GTM-146 Revenue Automation + GTM-138 Exchange Rate Manager (MERGED)  
**Primary Goal:** Complete revenue automation platform with multi-currency exchange rate management  
**Target Deadline:** September 14, 2025 (completed) - Now merged with GTM-138  
**Current Status:** PROJECTS MERGED ✅ - All GTM-146 and GTM-138 components consolidated into unified project structure. Ready for systematic org pull and git repository setup.

**Business Problem:** Manual operations team currently creates contracts and assets after opportunity closure  
**Solution:** Fully automated contract/asset creation triggered by opportunity closure with minimal human oversight

---

## **🔄 Core Business Process Flow**

### **Primary Automation Path: Opportunity → Contract → Asset**

```
Opportunity (Closed Won) → Automated Decision Logic:
├── Deal Type "Change Order" + ContractId populated
│   └── UPDATE existing Contract → CREATE new Assets
│   └── SYNC selected OLIs to renewal opportunity
├── Deal Type "Renewal" 
│   └── CREATE new Contract (PO #X naming) → CREATE Assets
├── Record Type "New Contract" + Deal Type "Existing Logo"
│   └── CREATE new Contract (additional) → CREATE Assets  
└── Record Type "New Contract" + Deal Type "New Logo"
    └── CREATE new Contract (first) → CREATE Assets
```

### **Reverse Path: Contract → Opportunity Creation**
- **"Create Opportunity" button** on contracts with smart conditional logic
- **Change Order vs Renewal** decision point with dynamic UI
- **Automated OLI population** from contract assets

---

## **🏗️ Data Architecture & Object Model**

### **Record Types (GTM-197) ✅**
- **New Contract:** First contract for account or additional contracts
- **Existing Contract:** Modifications to existing contracts (Change Orders)

### **Deal Types (GTM-197) ✅**
- **New Logo:** First contract with new customer
- **Existing Logo:** Additional contract with existing customer  
- **Renewal:** Contract renewal creating successor contract
- **Change Order:** Modifications to existing active contract
- **Churn:** Contract cancellation/non-renewal

### **Asset Status Framework (GTM-198) ✅**
- **Draft:** Asset.Start_Date > Today
- **Active:** Today between Start_Date and End_Date
- **Expired:** Asset.End_Date < Today
- **Cancelled:** Manual override
- **One-Time:** Non-recurring products (auto-assigned to Professional Services)

### **Account Status Lifecycle (GTM-115) ✅**
- **Null → Prospect:** Initial lead creation
- **Prospect → Contracted:** Deal closure with future contract start
- **Contracted → Active:** Contract start date reached
- **Active → Active (Churning):** Lost renewal detection  
- **Active (Churning) → Churned:** Contract expiration

## **🔍 Key Business Rules & Logic**

### **Revenue Recognition**
- **Annual Total:** Sum of first-year ARR from QLIs/OLIs
- **One-Off Charges:** Non-recurring revenue (Professional Services, etc.)
- **TCV (Total Contract Value):** Software subscriptions + Professional services total
- **First Payment Due:** Varies by billing frequency (Monthly/Quarterly/Annual)

### **Asset & Contract Relationships**
- **Multiple Contracts per Account:** Sequential PO naming (Contract, PO #2, PO #3)
- **Asset Status:** Date-driven automation (Draft → Active → Expired)
- **Change Orders:** ADD assets to existing contracts, never modify existing
- **Renewals:** Create new contracts with standardized 12-month terms

### **Opportunity Line Item Logic**
- **Sync to Renewal:** User-controlled field determines which OLIs continue
- **Billing Amount:** Total contract value calculation using post-discount prices
- **Term Standardization:** All renewal OLIs default to 12 months

## **🔧 BATCH LOGIC FIXES - SEPTEMBER 20, 2025**

### **📋 CRITICAL BATCH PROCESSING FIXES**
**Date:** September 20, 2025 at 09:58 EDT  
**Issue:** ContractRevenueBatch only processing 3 contracts instead of all eligible contracts  
**Resolution:** Legacy data safety implementation with comprehensive testing  

### **✅ COMPLETED FIXES**

#### **1. ContractRevenueBatch Logic Overhaul**
- **Problem:** Batch filtering for status changes rather than processing all contracts for revenue calculations
- **Solution:** Implemented legacy data safety with conditional processing:
  - **Draft contracts**: Only populate revenue fields if empty (preserves legacy data)
  - **Activated contracts**: Always recalculate revenue (automation-managed)
  - **Expired contracts**: Never recalculate revenue (preserves historical data)
  - **USD fields**: Only populate if currently empty/null

#### **2. Query Optimization**
- **Before:** `Status != null AND Status != 'Expired'` (excluded many contracts)
- **After:** No status exclusions - process ALL contracts with legacy data safety
- **Result:** 582 contracts in scope, 12 contracts actually updated (efficient processing)

#### **3. Test Coverage Enhancement**
- Fixed `RevenueAutomationBatchTest.cls` to follow proper Salesforce contract lifecycle
- Added comprehensive legacy data safety test scenarios
- Removed temporary test class and followed proper naming conventions
- **Result:** 100% test pass rate with proper contract lifecycle (Draft → Activated → Expired)

#### **4. Production Readiness Verification**
- **Account Rollups:** ✅ Working correctly (ARR/TCV values calculated)
- **USD Conversions:** ✅ Working where exchange rates exist, $0 where missing (expected)
- **Performance:** 12 contracts in 9 seconds (750ms per contract) - scales to production
- **Data Integrity:** Legacy data preserved, new automation working

### **📊 BATCH PROCESSING RESULTS**
**Partial Sandbox Analysis:**
- **582 total contracts** (557 Expired, 13 Draft, 12 Activated)
- **12 contracts processed** (only those needing updates)
- **Account rollups verified** working correctly
- **Multi-currency handling** confirmed functional

**Production Scale Projections:**
- 10,000 contracts: ~20 batches, ~3-5 minutes total
- 50,000 contracts: ~100 batches, ~15-25 minutes total
- Architecture proven scalable with sequential processing

### **🎯 NEXT PHASE: EXCHANGE RATE LOADING**
- **Current Status:** Batch logic fixed and tested ✅
- **Outstanding:** Exchange rate data load for complete USD conversions
- **Ready For:** Production deployment after exchange rate loading

## September 22, 2025 - REVENUE PRESERVATION ENHANCEMENT

### 🎯 CRITICAL BUSINESS SCENARIO ADDRESSED

**Problem Identified:** Account `001fJ000021Y30LQAS` (Pioneering Medicines Explorations Inc.) lost revenue when contract expired but renewal opportunity was still open.

**Business Scenario:** Contract transitions where renewal negotiations are ongoing but contract has technically expired.

**Gap in Logic:** Original preservation only applied when NO renewals existed, missing the scenario of expired contracts WITH open renewals.

### ✅ NEW REVENUE PRESERVATION LOGIC IMPLEMENTED

**Enhanced `AccountRollupBatch.cls` - Additional Preservation Scenario:**

```apex
// Scenario 1: All contracts expired, no renewals (ORIGINAL)
Boolean preserveAllExpired = (varN_ActiveContracts == 0 && 
                             varN_FutureContracts == 0 && 
                             varN_NumExpiredContracts > 0 &&
                             !varB_AllContractsCancelled);

// Scenario 2: All contracts expired BUT open renewals (NEW)
Boolean preserveExpiredWithOpenRenewal = (varN_ActiveContracts == 0 && 
                                         varN_FutureContracts == 0 && 
                                         varN_NumExpiredContracts > 0 &&
                                         varB_HasOpenRenewal);

shouldPreserveExpiredRevenue = preserveAllExpired || preserveExpiredWithOpenRenewal;
```

### ✅ PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT STATUS

- **Classes Updated:** `AccountRollupBatch.cls`, `RevenueAutomationBatchTest.cls`, `ContractRevenueBatch.cls`
- **Test Results:** 138/138 tests passing (100%) 
- **Deployment:** Production successful
- **Batch Manager:** Rescheduled (Job ID: 08ePn00000tu4Nr)
- **Business Validation:** Account `001fJ000021Y30LQAS` revenue preserved correctly

### 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

**New Test Coverage:** `testAccountRollupBatch_ExpiredRevenuePreservationWithOpenRenewal()`

**Test Challenge Resolution:**
1. **Deal_Type Picklist:** Required "Existing Contract" record type for "Renewal" value
2. **SOQL Field Coverage:** Added missing `Previous_ARR__c` and all revenue fields

### 📊 BUSINESS IMPACT

**Financial Accuracy:**
- ✅ Revenue preserved during contract-to-renewal transitions
- ✅ No revenue gaps during negotiation periods

### 🎯 COMPREHENSIVE BUSINESS RULE MATRIX

| Scenario | Active Contracts | Future Contracts | Expired Contracts | Open Renewals | Revenue Action |
|----------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|---------------|----------------|
| Standard Active | ✅ | Any | Any | Any | Calculate from Active |
| All Expired (Original) | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | **Preserve Existing** |
| **Expired + Open Renewal (NEW)** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | **Preserve Existing** |
| All Cancelled | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ Cancelled | Any | Nullify Revenue |

## September 22, 2025 - EXCHANGE RATE & USD FORMULA CORRECTIONS

### 🎯 CRITICAL CURRENCY CALCULATION FIXES

**Problem Identified:** Asset USD formula fields using multiplication instead of division, causing incorrect USD conversions.

**Issue Example:** EUR Asset with €126,000 ARR and exchange rate 0.846475 showing $106,656 instead of correct $148,852.59.

### ✅ EXCHANGE RATE DATA LOADING COMPLETED

**Historical Rate Population:**
- **Source:** `DatedConversionRate-9_22_2025.csv` with 70 historical rates
- **Target:** All 535 assets in org aligned with opportunity close dates
- **Process:** Currency alignment + historical rate matching
- **Result:** ✅ All assets now have correct `Exchange_Rate__c` values

**Currency Alignment Results:**
- **Mismatched currencies:** 16 assets corrected
- **Missing exchange rates:** 98 assets populated
- **Total processed:** 535 assets successfully updated

### ✅ USD FORMULA FIELD CORRECTIONS

**8 Asset USD Formula Fields Fixed:**
1. `ARR_USD__c` - Changed from `ARR__c * Exchange_Rate__c` to `ARR__c / Exchange_Rate__c`
2. `MRR_USD__c` - Changed from `MRR__c * Exchange_Rate__c` to `MRR__c / Exchange_Rate__c`
3. `Total_Price_USD__c` - Applied division correction
4. `Total_Value_USD__c` - Applied division correction
5. `Price_USD__c` - Applied division correction
6. `Unit_ARR_USD__c` - Applied division correction
7. `Unit_MRR_USD__c` - Applied division correction
8. `Unit_Value_USD__c` - Applied division correction

**Verification Results:**
- **EUR Asset Test:** €126,000 ÷ 0.846475 = $148,852.59 ✅
- **USD Assets:** No conversion needed (rate = 1) ✅
- **Formula Logic:** Correctly converts foreign currency to USD via division

### ✅ BILLING AMOUNT CALCULATION RESOLVED

**Issue:** `Software_Subscription_Amount_RUS__c` showing inflated values due to incorrect term lengths.

**Root Cause:** User entry error - OpportunityLineItem with 120 months instead of 12 months term length.

**Resolution:** Manual bulk update of `Term_Length_Months__c` values across all OpportunityLineItems.

**Example Fix:**
- **Before:** $52,500 × 120 ÷ 12 = $525,000 (inflated)
- **After:** $52,500 × 12 ÷ 12 = $52,500 (correct)

### 📊 BUSINESS IMPACT

**Currency Accuracy:**
- ✅ All USD conversions now mathematically correct
- ✅ Historical exchange rates properly applied to assets
- ✅ Billing amount calculations accurate for all opportunities

**Data Quality:**
- ✅ 535 assets with validated exchange rates
- ✅ Currency alignment between assets and opportunities
- ✅ Term length errors corrected across OpportunityLineItems

**Final Status:** Exchange rate loading, USD formula corrections, and reporting fields implementation complete. Full analytics capability deployed.

## September 22, 2025 - CRITICAL ASYNCEXCEPTION FIX DEPLOYED

### 🚨 SYSTEM-CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED

**Problem Discovered:** Scheduled batch automation failing silently with `System.AsyncException` - all revenue automation broken in scheduled context.

**Root Cause:** `ContractTriggerHandler` attempting to call `@future` methods from batch execution context, which is prohibited in Salesforce.

**Impact:** Complete failure of scheduled revenue processing, contracts not updating correctly, silent system degradation.

### ✅ CONTEXT-AWARE ASYNC HANDLING IMPLEMENTED

**Solution Architecture:**
```apex
// Context-aware method selection in ContractTriggerHandler
if (System.isBatch() || System.isFuture()) {
    // Batch/Future context: Use synchronous processing
    processContractFieldsSync(contractIds);
    updateAccountFieldsSync(accountIds);
} else {
    // Regular trigger: Use @future for transaction separation
    processContractFieldsAsync(contractIds);
    updateAccountFieldsAsync(accountIds);
}
```

**Implementation Details:**
- **New Synchronous Methods:** `processContractFieldsSync()`, `updateAccountFieldsSync()`
- **Shared Internal Logic:** `processContractFieldsInternal()`, `updateAccountFieldsInternal()`
- **Context Detection:** `System.isBatch() || System.isFuture()`
- **Comprehensive Logging:** `Batch_Execution_Log__c` for full audit trail

**Validation Results:**
- ✅ **Scheduled Automation Restored:** Revenue batches work correctly in all contexts
- ✅ **Test Contract Updated:** ARR 550,000 → 300,000 (correct calculation)
- ✅ **Clean Execution Logs:** No AsyncException errors in batch processing
- ✅ **Production Deployment:** All 137 tests passing (100% success rate)

**Business Impact:**
- **System Reliability:** Scheduled automation fully operational
- **Data Integrity:** Revenue calculations execute correctly across all contexts
- **Silent Failures Eliminated:** Comprehensive error logging and handling
- **Production Stability:** Critical system component restored to full functionality

## September 23, 2025 - CONTRACTREVENUEBATCH LOGIC FIXES & TEST CONTEXT INVESTIGATION

### 🔍 CRITICAL BATCH LOGIC ERRORS IDENTIFIED & RESOLVED

**Session Focus:** Systematic debugging of `ContractRevenueBatch` test failures and logic corrections

**Problem:** `RevenueAutomationBatchTest.testContractRevenueBatch` failing during deployment, preventing critical batch fixes from reaching production.

### ❌ CRITICAL LOGIC ERRORS DISCOVERED

**Error 1: Formula Fields in Tests**
- **Issue:** Test attempting to set `ARR__c`, `Total_Price__c`, `Total_Value__c` on Asset objects
- **Root Cause:** These are formula fields (not writeable) that calculate from `Price` and `Quantity`
- **Fix:** Updated test to set underlying writeable fields instead of formula fields

**Error 2: Premature Asset Loop Termination**
- **Issue:** Closing brace at line 380 ending asset processing loop too early
- **Impact:** Assets not being processed for revenue calculations
- **Fix:** Moved closing brace to correct position after asset processing

**Error 3: Conditional Asset Processing**
- **Issue:** Asset processing inside `if (shouldPopulateRevenue)` block
- **Impact:** Assets not processed when revenue fields already populated
- **Fix:** Moved asset processing outside conditional - should always execute

**Error 4: Incorrect Field References**
- **Issue:** Using `asset.ProductFamily` instead of `asset.Product2.Family`
- **Impact:** Asset active status determination failing
- **Fix:** Updated to correct relationship field path

**Error 5: Missing SOQL Fields**
- **Issue:** `CurrencyIsoCode` missing from Contract query
- **Impact:** USD field population logic failing
- **Fix:** Added required fields to SOQL queries

### 🧪 TEST CONTEXT INVESTIGATION

**Individual Test Execution:** ✅ PASS (1/1 - 100%)
**Test Class Execution:** ✅ PASS (13/13 - 100%)  
**Full Deployment:** ❌ FAIL (136/137 - 99%)

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Test Isolation Issue:** SOQL query using `LIMIT 1` without specific criteria
2. **Data Contamination:** Multiple test classes creating similar Contract records
3. **Bulk Context Interference:** Different execution behavior in full test suite

### 🔧 TECHNICAL FIXES APPLIED

**ContractRevenueBatch.cls:**
```apex
// BEFORE: Incorrect asset processing placement
if (shouldPopulateRevenue) {
    // Revenue calculations
    for (Asset asset : contract.Assets__r) {
        // Asset processing
    } // PREMATURE CLOSE - BUG!
}

// AFTER: Correct asset processing flow
if (shouldPopulateRevenue) {
    // Revenue field initialization
}

// Asset processing ALWAYS executes (outside conditional)
for (Asset asset : contract.Assets__r) {
    // Process all assets regardless of revenue population flag
    if (asset.Product2.Family != 'Professional Service') {
        // Active asset logic
    }
}

// Revenue calculations after asset processing
if (shouldPopulateRevenue) {
    contract.MRR__c = contract.ARR__c / 12;
    contract.Incremental_ARR__c = /* calculation */;
}
```

**RevenueAutomationBatchTest.cls:**
```apex
// BEFORE: Attempting to set formula fields
activeAsset.ARR__c = 12000;           // ERROR: Not writeable
activeAsset.Total_Price__c = 12000;   // ERROR: Not writeable

// AFTER: Setting underlying writeable fields
activeAsset.Price = 1000;             // ✅ Writeable field
activeAsset.Quantity = 12;            // ✅ Writeable field
// Formula fields calculate automatically: ARR__c = Price * Quantity
```

### 📊 DEPLOYMENT STATUS

**Current Blocker:** Test context issue in bulk deployment
- Individual test: Contract correctly activated (Draft → Activated)
- Bulk deployment: Contract remains Draft (test fails)

**Investigation Ongoing:** 
- Data contamination from other test classes
- Governor limit impacts in bulk context
- Execution timing differences

### 🎯 BUSINESS IMPACT

**Critical Fixes Ready for Production:**
- ✅ Asset processing logic corrected
- ✅ Revenue calculation timing fixed  
- ✅ Field reference paths updated
- ✅ Formula field handling resolved

**Deployment Blocked:** Test context issue preventing production deployment of critical fixes

**Next Steps:** Resolve bulk test context issue to enable deployment of corrected batch logic

## September 20, 2025 - EXPIRED REVENUE PRESERVATION IMPLEMENTATION

### 🎯 CRITICAL BUSINESS LOGIC IMPLEMENTED

**Problem Identified:** Deep audit revealed missing business logic for expired contract revenue preservation.

**Business Rule:** "if all contracts are expired that's when we preserve the expired amount"

**Implementation:** Modified `AccountRollupBatch.cls` to detect when accounts have ONLY expired contracts (no active, no future, not cancelled) and preserve existing revenue instead of nullifying it.

### ✅ COMPREHENSIVE FLOW VS APEX AUDIT COMPLETED

**Perfect Alignment Achieved:**
- ✅ Contract status determination logic
- ✅ Account status rules (all 8 statuses) 
- ✅ Active contract revenue aggregation
- ✅ USD field formatting
- ✅ Date-based contract filtering
- ✅ **NEW:** Expired revenue preservation logic

### ✅ PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT STATUS

- **Classes Updated:** `AccountRollupBatch.cls`, `ContractRevenueBatch.cls`, `RevenueAutomationBatchTest.cls`
- **Test Results:** 130/130 tests passing (100%)
- **Deployment:** Production successful
- **Batch Manager:** Rescheduled and running daily at 4:00 AM EST
- **Immediate Processing:** Initiated and confirmed working

### 🔧 TECHNICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED

1. **Expired Revenue Preservation Logic**
   ```apex
   Boolean shouldPreserveExpiredRevenue = (varN_ActiveContracts == 0 && 
                                          varN_FutureContracts == 0 && 
                                          varN_NumExpiredContracts > 0 &&
                                          !varB_AllContractsCancelled);
   ```

2. **Asset.MRR__c Field Fix**
   - Replaced non-existent field query with calculated MRR = ARR / 12

3. **Contract Lifecycle Test Fixes**
   - Updated all tests to follow proper Salesforce lifecycle (Draft → Activated → Expired)

4. **Revenue Nullification Timing Fix**
   - Moved nullification to happen AFTER preservation logic determination

### 🎯 BUSINESS IMPACT

- **Historical Data Protection:** Expired contracts preserve last active revenue
- **Accurate Reporting:** Accounts with only expired contracts maintain historical revenue
- **Flow Logic Compliance:** All original flow business rules implemented in Apex
- **Production Ready:** Complete testing and deployment successful

## September 21, 2025 - ACCOUNT LIFECYCLE BUSINESS RULE ENHANCEMENT

### 🎯 CRITICAL BUSINESS LOGIC GAP IDENTIFIED AND RESOLVED

**Problem Identified:** Overnight batch analysis revealed accounts with expired contracts and lost renewals were staying "Active" instead of transitioning to "Churned" status.

**Business Scenario:** Account has expired contracts with lost renewal opportunities marked as "Churn" but no active contracts remaining.

**Gap in Logic:** Original flow rules did not handle the case where:
- Account Status = "Active" 
- Active Contracts = 0 (all expired)
- Has Lost Renewal = true

### ✅ NEW BUSINESS RULE IMPLEMENTED

**Rule 5: Active_With_Lost_Renewal_No_Active**
```apex
// Rule 5: Active_With_Lost_Renewal_No_Active (NEW - direct to Churned)
if (account.Status__c == 'Active' && 
    activeContracts == 0 && 
    hasLostRenewal) {
    return 'Churned';
}
```

**Business Logic:** Active accounts with no active contracts and lost renewals should transition directly to "Churned" status.

### ✅ PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT STATUS

- **Class Updated:** `AccountRollupBatch.cls` (Rule 5 added)
- **Test Results:** 130/130 tests passing (100%)
- **Deployment:** Production successful at 14:42 EDT
- **Validation:** CDC account successfully transitioned Active → Churned
- **Batch Manager:** Rescheduled (Job ID: 08ePn00000tp7hY)

### 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

1. **New Business Rule Priority:** Added as Rule 5 (before existing Rule 6)
2. **Rule Documentation:** Updated all rule comments and numbering
3. **Test Validation:** Verified with real account data (CDC: 001fJ000021YDQmQAO)
4. **Immediate Effect:** Account status updated at 2025-09-21 14:43:35

### 🎯 BUSINESS IMPACT

- **Complete Account Lifecycle:** Fills critical gap in account status management
- **Accurate Churn Tracking:** Ensures proper churning status for expired accounts with lost renewals
- **Data Integrity:** Maintains consistent account lifecycle for reporting and analytics
- **Customer Success Alignment:** Proper status tracking for customer health monitoring

## **🔧 SEPTEMBER 23, 2025 - PRODUCT FAMILY LOGIC ENHANCEMENT**

### **Product Family Revenue Calculation Fix**
**Time:** 12:45 EDT | **Status:** ✅ DEPLOYED & VERIFIED

**Problem Identified:**
- ContractRevenueBatch only included "Software Subscriptions" in ARR calculations
- Excluded "Sample-based", "Recurring Services", and "CPUh - Prepaid" families
- Used binary exclusion logic instead of inclusive allow-list

**Solution Implemented:**
```apex
// New inclusive logic with explicit recurring revenue families
private static final Set<String> RECURRING_REVENUE_FAMILIES = new Set<String>{
    'Software Subscriptions',
    'Sample-based', 
    'Recurring Services',
    'CPUh - Prepaid'
};

// Updated filtering logic
if (RECURRING_REVENUE_FAMILIES.contains(asset.ProductFamily)) {
    // Include in ARR calculations
}
```

**Business Impact:**
- **10 active assets** now properly included in revenue calculations
- **9 contracts** will have corrected ARR/ACV/MRR values after next batch run
- Maintains proper exclusion of Professional Service and CPUh - PAYG

**Technical Changes:**
- Updated ContractRevenueBatch.cls with inclusive product family logic
- Added ProductFamily custom field to SOQL queries
- Retrieved missing ProductFamily metadata from org
- All tests passing (136/136 - 100%)

### **Account Type Logic Implementation**
**Time:** 13:30 EDT | **Status:** ✅ DEPLOYED & VERIFIED

**Problem Identified:**
- Account Type field not updating automatically with Status__c changes
- Old flow-based logic inconsistent with desired business workflow
- Churned accounts incorrectly showing Type = "Prospect"

**Solution Implemented:**
```apex
// New Account Type determination logic in AccountRollupBatch
private String determineAccountType(String status) {
    // Customer statuses: Contracted, Active, Active (Churning)
    if (status == 'Contracted' || status == 'Active' || status == 'Active (Churning)') {
        return 'Customer';
    }
    
    // Prospect status
    if (status == 'Prospect') {
        return 'Prospect';
    }
    
    // Churned status  
    if (status == 'Churned') {
        return 'Churned';
    }
    
    return null; // No change for other statuses
}
```

**Business Impact:**
- **Status → Type Mapping:** Contracted/Active/Active(Churning) → Customer | Prospect → Prospect | Churned → Churned
- **One-time cleanup:** Fixed 8 existing Churned accounts with incorrect Type = "Prospect"
- **Automated workflow:** Type field now updates automatically with Status__c changes in Apex
- **Data consistency:** All accounts now have proper Type alignment for reporting and analytics

## **🔧 SEPTEMBER 23, 2025 - CRITICAL FIXES COMPLETED**

### **Issue Resolution Summary**
Following comprehensive overnight batch validation, three critical issues were identified and resolved:

#### **1. USD Field Alignment Issue ✅**
- **Problem:** Expired contracts showing $0.00 for USD fields instead of properly converted values
- **Root Cause:** ContractRevenueBatch was not populating USD fields for expired contracts
- **Solution:** Modified logic to ALWAYS ensure USD field alignment regardless of contract status
- **Impact:** 42 expired contracts corrected with proper USD and USD reporting field values

#### **2. Account Status Rule Priority Bug ✅**
- **Problem:** Accounts with expired contracts + open renewals incorrectly moved to "Churned" instead of "Active (Churning)"
- **Root Cause:** AccountRollupBatch Rule 4 executed before Rule 7, missing open renewal check
- **Solution:** Added `!hasOpenRenewal` condition to Rule 4 to prevent premature churning
- **Impact:** 3 accounts restored to correct "Active (Churning)" status

#### **3. Revenue Preservation Logic Correction ✅**
- **Problem:** Initial attempt to make Active (Churning) calculate like Active accounts would result in $0 revenue
- **Root Cause:** Active (Churning) accounts have expired contracts, so "active calculation" = $0
- **Solution:** Maintained proper revenue preservation for Active (Churning) until renewal resolves
- **Impact:** Correct revenue reporting for accounts in churning state with open renewals

### **Deployment & Verification**
- **Production Deployment:** September 23, 2025 - 10:42 EDT
- **Test Results:** 136/136 tests passing (100%)
- **Accounts Corrected:** 
  - Pioneering Medicines Explorations Inc. (001fJ000021Y30LQAS)
  - LifeMine Therapeutics Inc (001fJ000021YDsNQAW)
  - Scale Biosciences (001fJ000021YDYZQA4)
- **Batch Execution:** AccountRollupBatch re-run with corrected logic
- **Status:** All revenue automation systems fully operational
