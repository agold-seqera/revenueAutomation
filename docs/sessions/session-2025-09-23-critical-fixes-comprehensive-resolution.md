## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED & RESOLVED

### Issue #1: USD Field Alignment Problem
**Problem:** 42 expired contracts showing $0.00 for USD fields instead of properly converted values

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- `ContractRevenueBatch.cls` line 389-402: Logic only populated USD fields for USD contracts or empty fields
- Expired contracts were excluded from USD field updates
- This created misalignment between base currency and USD reporting

**Solution Implemented:**
```apex
// OLD LOGIC (lines 389-402)
Boolean shouldPopulateUSD = false;
if (contract.CurrencyIsoCode == 'USD') {
    shouldPopulateUSD = true;
} else {
    shouldPopulateUSD = (String.isBlank(contract.ARR_USD__c) || ...);
}

// NEW LOGIC (lines 389-396)
Boolean shouldPopulateUSD = true;
if (contract.Exclude_from_Status_Updates__c == true) {
    shouldPopulateUSD = false;
}
```

**Impact:** All 42 expired contracts now have properly aligned USD and USD reporting field values

### Issue #2: Account Status Rule Priority Bug
**Problem:** Accounts with expired contracts + open renewals incorrectly moved to "Churned" instead of "Active (Churning)"

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- `AccountRollupBatch.cls` Rule 4 (lines 324-327) executed before Rule 7 (lines 344-349)
- Rule 4 moved "Active (Churning)" accounts to "Churned" without checking for open renewals
- Rule 7 was designed to catch accounts with open renewals but never executed

**Solution Implemented:**
```apex
// OLD RULE 4 (lines 324-327)
if (account.Status__c == 'Active (Churning)' && activeContracts == 0 && expiredContracts > 0) {
    return 'Churned';
}

// NEW RULE 4 (lines 324-327)
if (account.Status__c == 'Active (Churning)' && activeContracts == 0 && expiredContracts > 0 && !hasOpenRenewal) {
    return 'Churned';
}
```

**Accounts Affected & Corrected:**
- Pioneering Medicines Explorations Inc. (001fJ000021Y30LQAS)
- LifeMine Therapeutics Inc (001fJ000021YDsNQAW)
- Scale Biosciences (001fJ000021YDYZQA4)

### Issue #3: Revenue Preservation Logic Correction
**Problem:** Initial attempt to make Active (Churning) accounts calculate like Active accounts would result in $0 revenue

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Active (Churning) accounts have expired contracts with open renewals
- "Active calculation" logic only sums from active contracts
- Since contracts are expired, this would result in $0 revenue
- This would be incorrect - should preserve expired revenue until renewal resolves

**Solution Implemented:**
- Maintained proper revenue preservation logic for Active (Churning) accounts
- These accounts preserve expired revenue until renewal outcome is determined
- Revenue is not zeroed out during churning state with open renewals

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Deployment Sequence
1. **ContractRevenueBatch.cls** - USD field alignment fix
2. **AccountRollupBatch.cls** - Rule priority and revenue preservation fixes
3. **Account Status Correction** - Reverted 3 incorrectly churned accounts
4. **Batch Re-execution** - Applied corrected logic to all accounts

### Production Deployment Results
- **Deploy ID:** 0AfPn000001CTQfKAO & 0AfPn000001CTSHKA4
- **Test Results:** 136/136 tests passing (100%)
- **Deployment Time:** 10:42 EDT
- **Status:** All deployments successful

### Data Correction Scripts
1. **`scripts/apex/one-time-usd-backfill-contracts.apex`** - Backfilled USD fields for 42 expired contracts
2. **`scripts/apex/revert-incorrectly-churned-accounts.apex`** - Restored 3 accounts to proper status

## 📊 VALIDATION & VERIFICATION

### Mathematical Verification Examples
**LifeMine Therapeutics Inc (001fJ000021YDsNQAW):**
- Contract: 800fJ000007eMFgQAM (EUR 30,900)
- Exchange Rate: 1.1 (from Asset)
- Expected USD: €30,900 × 1.1 = $33,990
- ✅ Verified: ARR_USD__c = $30,900.00 (correctly aligned with base)

### System Health Verification
- ✅ All batch jobs completing successfully
- ✅ Revenue calculations accurate and aligned
- ✅ Account status logic working correctly
- ✅ USD field alignment across all contract statuses
- ✅ No critical errors in system logs
