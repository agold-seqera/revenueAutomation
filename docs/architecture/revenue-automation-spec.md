# GTM-146 Revenue Automation - Updated Technical Specification

## Executive Summary

**Epic:** GTM-146 Revenue Automation  
**Objective:** Eliminate manual operations work and automate contract/asset creation processes  
**Target Date:** September 14, 2025  
**Primary Constraint:** Development time allocation across concurrent projects (GTM-138, GlobalData Integration)

## Project Scope Overview

### Core Business Challenge
- **Current State:** Manual operations team creates contracts and assets after opportunity closure
- **Desired State:** Automated contract/asset creation triggered by opportunity closure with minimal human oversight
- **Secondary Issues:** Exchange rate sync challenges (addressed in separate GTM-138 epic)

### Success Metrics
- Eliminate manual contract/asset creation workload
- Ensure seamless object relationships (Opportunity â†’ Contract â†’ Asset)
- Maintain revenue recognition accuracy through automated date calculations
- Provide operational visibility through proactive notifications

## Data Architecture & Object Relationships

### Opportunity Structure Redesign

#### Record Types (GTM-197)
- **New Contract:** First contract for account or additional contracts for existing accounts
- **Existing Contract:** Modifications to existing contracts (Change Orders)

#### Deal Types (GTM-197)
- **New Logo:** First contract with new customer account
- **Existing Logo:** Additional contract with existing customer account  
- **Renewal:** Contract renewal creating successor contract
- **Change Order:** Modifications to existing active contract
- **Churn:** Contract cancellation or non-renewal (retained for reporting)

### Contract Lifecycle Model

```
Account
â”œâ”€â”€ Contract A (Original)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Assets (Status: Expired - dates have passed)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Related Opportunities (Closed)
â”œâ”€â”€ Contract B (PO #2 - Current) 
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Assets (Status: Active - within date range)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Related Opportunities (Closed/Pipeline)
â””â”€â”€ Contract C (PO #3 - Future)
    â”œâ”€â”€ Assets (Status: Draft - future start dates)
    â””â”€â”€ Related Opportunities (Closed/Pipeline)
```

### Asset Status Framework (GTM-196, GTM-198)

#### Status Types
- **Draft:** Asset.Start_Date > Today
- **Active:** Today between Asset.Start_Date and Asset.End_Date
- **Expired:** Asset.End_Date < Today  
- **Cancelled:** Manual override status
- **One-Time:** Asset classification for non-recurring products

#### Date-Driven Automation
- Asset status updates via daily batch processing based on date field evaluation
- Multiple contracts can be simultaneously active with different Asset date ranges
- Contract state context derived from Asset composition, not maintained separately

### Account Status Lifecycle Framework (Enhanced GTM-115, GTM-210)

#### Complete 5-State Status Lifecycle
- **Null â†’ Prospect:** Initial lead/contact creation
- **Prospect â†’ Contracted:** Deal closure with future contract start date (GTM-210)
- **Contracted â†’ Active:** Contract start date reached with active assets
- **Active â†’ Active (Churning):** Lost renewal detection (Closed Lost + Deal Type = "Churn")
- **Active (Churning) â†’ Churned:** Contract expiration without renewal

#### Daily Batch Processing Architecture
- **Scheduled Flow:** `Scheduled_Flow_Daily_Update_Accounts`
- **Revenue Calculations:** ARR/TCV/ACV/MRR across ALL contracts (MRR = ARR/12)
- **Contract Categorization:** Active/Future/Expired counting and classification
- **Revenue Field Management:** Nullification and recalculation patterns
- **Decision Logic:** Multiple conditional outcomes with comprehensive status management

## Core Automation Workflows

### Forward Flow: Opportunity â†’ Contract â†’ Asset

#### Automation Decision Logic
```
Opportunity.StageName = Closed Won
â”œâ”€â”€ Deal_Type__c = "Change Order" + ContractId populated
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ UPDATE existing Contract â†’ CREATE new Assets
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ SYNC OLIs marked "Sync to Renewal = Yes" to related renewal opportunity
â”œâ”€â”€ Deal_Type__c = "Renewal"
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ CREATE new Contract (PO #X naming) â†’ CREATE Assets
â”œâ”€â”€ Record_Type = "New Contract" + Deal_Type__c = "Existing Logo"  
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ CREATE new Contract (additional contract for account) â†’ CREATE Assets
â””â”€â”€ Record_Type = "New Contract" + Deal_Type__c = "New Logo"
    â””â”€â”€ CREATE new Contract (first contract for account) â†’ CREATE Assets
```

#### Asset Creation Standards (GTM-172, GTM-196)
- **Trigger:** Automatic on Contract creation/update
- **Data Flow:** OLI fields â†’ Asset fields with term dates and prorations
- **Multi-Year Handling:** Standardized date calculations for varying term lengths
- **Historical Preservation:** Change Orders only ADD assets, never modify existing
- **Revenue Calculations:** Asset dates drive all financial recognition periods
- **Renewal Integration:** OLI "Sync to Renewal" field determines which assets sync to future renewal opportunities

### Reverse Flow: Contract â†’ Opportunity â†’ Asset Sync

#### Contract-Initiated Opportunity Creation (GTM-174)
```
User clicks "Create Opportunity" on Contract
â””â”€â”€ Screen Flow Decision Point
    â”œâ”€â”€ "Change Order" selected
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ CREATE Opportunity (Deal_Type = "Change Order", ContractId pre-populated)
    â””â”€â”€ "Renewal" selected
        â””â”€â”€ Check if Renewal Opportunity exists
            â”œâ”€â”€ EXISTS: Navigate to existing Opportunity
            â””â”€â”€ DOESN'T EXIST: CREATE Renewal Opportunity
```

**Enhanced Implementation Features:**
- Smart conditional logic based on `Contract.Renewal_Opportunity__c`
- Dynamic UI options with sophisticated UX workflows
- Complete OCR and OLI creation from contract assets
- Asset-to-OpportunityLineItem conversion automation
- Advanced Salesforce Flow XML structure with proper element grouping

#### Enhanced Asset Selection Framework (GTM-212)

**OLI-Level Renewal Selection (Primary Method):**
- **Field Addition:** "Sync to Renewal" (Yes/No) field on every OLI  
- **Validation:** Required field - all OLIs must have Yes/No selection before Change Order close (GTM-212)
- **Performance Optimization:** Conditional logic with admin exclusions for user experience
- **Sync Logic:** Only OLIs marked "Yes" sync to related renewal opportunity
- **User Experience:** Rep decides during deal progression which products continue to renewal

**Standard Sync Capability:**
- **"Sync Latest Products" Button:** Auto-populate all Software Subscription assets as OLIs
- **Use Case:** Quick refresh for standard renewals after change orders

**Advanced Selection Interface (Legacy/Backup):**
- **"Select Products" Button:** Screen Flow with Asset data table (maintained for edge cases)
- **Functionality:** 
  - Multi-select grid displaying all Contract Assets
  - Filter options (Product Family, Asset Type, Status)
  - Selective OLI creation from chosen Assets
- **Strategic Value:** Include Professional Services, one-time revenue, custom configurations

### Renewal Automation Process (GTM-195)

#### Automatic Renewal Creation
- **Trigger:** Deal closure (any Deal_Type that creates new contract)
- **Logic:** Create follow-on renewal opportunity for contract continuation
- **Product Population:** Auto-create OLIs from Software Subscription assets on the related contract
- **Timing:** Immediate upon contract creation
- **Ownership:** Inherit from closed opportunity or assign via territory rules
