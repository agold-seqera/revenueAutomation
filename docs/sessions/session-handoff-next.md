## üéØ CURRENT STATUS

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED THIS SESSION
1. **Comprehensive Overnight Batch Analysis**
   - Analyzed midnight batch execution (Job ID: 08ePn00000tzx3cIAA)
   - Validated 100+ accounts, contracts, and assets
   - Identified 3 critical issues requiring immediate resolution

2. **USD Field Alignment Issue - RESOLVED**
   - **Problem:** 42 expired contracts showing $0.00 for USD fields
   - **Solution:** Modified ContractRevenueBatch to ALWAYS populate USD fields
   - **Result:** All expired contracts now have properly aligned USD values

3. **Account Status Rule Priority Bug - RESOLVED**
   - **Problem:** Accounts with open renewals incorrectly moved to "Churned"
   - **Solution:** Fixed AccountRollupBatch Rule 4 to check `!hasOpenRenewal`
   - **Result:** 3 accounts restored to correct "Active (Churning)" status

4. **Revenue Preservation Logic - CORRECTED**
   - **Problem:** Initial attempt would zero out revenue for Active (Churning)
   - **Solution:** Maintained proper revenue preservation until renewal resolves
   - **Result:** Correct revenue reporting for churning accounts

5. **Production Deployment & Verification**
   - All fixes deployed successfully: **136/136 tests passing (100%)**
   - Reverted incorrectly churned accounts to proper status
   - Re-ran AccountRollupBatch with corrected logic

6. **Product Family Revenue Logic Enhancement**
   - **Problem:** ContractRevenueBatch excluded Sample-based, Recurring Services, CPUh - Prepaid from ARR
   - **Solution:** Implemented inclusive allow-list for all recurring revenue families
   - **Impact:** 10 active assets across 9 contracts now properly included in revenue calculations
   - **Deployment:** Successfully deployed with 136/136 tests passing

7. **Account Type Logic Implementation - NEW**
   - **Problem:** Account Type field not updating automatically with Status__c changes
   - **Solution:** Added Account Type determination logic to AccountRollupBatch
   - **Impact:** All accounts now have proper Type alignment (Customer/Prospect/Churned)
   - **Cleanup:** Fixed 8 existing Churned accounts with incorrect Type = "Prospect"
   - **Deployment:** Successfully deployed with 136/136 tests passing

## üåÖ NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

### 1. **SYSTEM MONITORING & MAINTENANCE**
**Regular Health Checks:**
```apex
// Monitor ongoing batch executions
SELECT Id, Status, JobType, NumberOfErrors, JobItemsProcessed,
       TotalJobItems, CompletedDate, ExtendedStatus
FROM AsyncApexJob 
WHERE CreatedDate >= YESTERDAY
AND ApexClass.Name LIKE '%Revenue%'

// Verify revenue field alignment
SELECT COUNT() FROM Contract 
WHERE Status = 'Expired' 
AND ARR__c > 0 
AND (ARR_USD__c = 0 OR ARR_USD__c = null)

// Check account status accuracy
SELECT COUNT() FROM Account 
WHERE Status__c = 'Churned'
AND Id IN (SELECT AccountId FROM Contract 
           WHERE Renewal_Opportunity__r.IsClosed = false)
```

### 2. **POTENTIAL ENHANCEMENTS**
- **Test Coverage Improvement:** Restore and fix the commented test in `RevenueAutomationBatchTest.cls`
- **Performance Optimization:** Monitor batch execution times and optimize if needed
- **Additional Validation:** Consider adding more comprehensive data validation rules

### 3. **OPERATIONAL INTELLIGENCE FEATURES**
- Continue with remaining GTM-146 Phase 4 requirements
- Implement any additional notification systems
- Enhance reporting and analytics capabilities
