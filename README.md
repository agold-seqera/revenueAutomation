## ⚠️ **PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST**

### **🔔 Slack Channel Configuration**
**CRITICAL:** Before deploying notification flows to production, update Slack channel IDs in the following flows:

**Current Configuration Analysis:**

**✅ Environment-Aware (Ready):**
- **GTM-115 (Churn):** Uses `forT_ChurnAlert_Channel` formula
  - Production: `C05KN98CAHF` 
  - Sandbox: `C090R82MJ6L` (#test-alex-alerts)

**❌ Hardcoded to Test Channel (Needs Update):**
- **GTM-156 (Monthly):** Hardcoded to `C090R82MJ6L`
- **GTM-211 (6-Month):** Hardcoded to `C090R82MJ6L`

**Reference Pattern (from Deal Won Alerts):**
- **Sales Closed Won:** Production `C05KN98CAHF`, Sandbox `C090R82MJ6L`
- **Sales Ops:** Production `C0522LPEV9T`, Sandbox `C090R82MJ6L`

**Action Required Before Production Deployment:**

1. **Update GTM-156 & GTM-211:**
   - Replace hardcoded `C090R82MJ6L` with environment-aware formulas
   - Add CASE logic similar to GTM-115 pattern
   
2. **Verify Production Channel IDs:**
   - Confirm correct production channels for each notification type
   - Contract expirations → Sales Ops channel (`C0522LPEV9T`)?
   - Churn alerts → Sales Closed Won channel (`C05KN98CAHF`)?
   
3. **Test Production Deployment:**
   - Deploy to production environment
   - Trigger test notifications to verify proper channel routing
   - Confirm message formatting displays correctly in production channels
