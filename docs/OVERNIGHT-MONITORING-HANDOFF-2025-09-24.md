# Overnight Monitoring Handoff - September 24, 2025

**Session:** Overnight Batch Investigation  
**Date:** September 24, 2025  
**Time:** 10:40 EDT  
**Next Batch Execution:** September 25, 2025 at 4:00 AM UTC (Midnight EDT)

---

## üéØ **CRITICAL MONITORING REQUIRED**

Two records have been identified with anomalous behavior that requires overnight monitoring to confirm system stability.

---

## üìã **RECORD 1: CARIS LIFE SCIENCES ACCOUNT**

### **Record Details:**
- **Account ID:** 001fJ000021YBjKQAW
- **Account Name:** Caris Life Sciences
- **Current Status:** Active (reset for monitoring)
- **Expected Status:** Active (Churning)

### **Issue Summary:**
- Originally failed to update from "Active" to "Active (Churning)" during September 23rd overnight batch
- Manual and scheduled testing today confirmed logic works correctly
- Account should transition to "Active (Churning)" based on:
  - Active contract until 2025-09-30
  - Closed Lost renewal opportunity with Deal_Type = 'Churn'

### **Monitoring Instructions:**
```sql
-- Check account status after overnight batch (run after 4:30 AM UTC)
SELECT Id, Name, Status__c, LastModifiedDate, LastModifiedBy.Name 
FROM Account 
WHERE Id = '001fJ000021YBjKQAW'
```

### **Expected Result:**
- **Status__c:** Should change from "Active" to "Active (Churning)"
- **LastModifiedBy:** Sys Admin (automated process)
- **LastModifiedDate:** Should be around 4:00-4:30 AM UTC on September 25

### **Alert Conditions:**
- ‚ùå Status remains "Active" after batch completion
- ‚ùå No modification by Sys Admin during batch window
- ‚ùå Any errors in batch execution logs

## üìã **RECORD 2: ALMIRALL ASSET**

### **Record Details:**
- **Asset ID:** 02ifJ000000EKA9QAO
- **Account:** Almirall (001fJ000021YCbNQAW)
- **Product:** Seqera Platform User License - Enterprise Pipelines
- **Current Status:** Purchased (reset for monitoring)
- **Expected Status:** Purchased (should NOT change)

### **Issue Summary:**
- Was incorrectly changed to "Active" status on September 23rd
- Should remain "Purchased" until Start_Date__c (December 17, 2025)
- AssetStatusBatch testing confirmed logic works correctly
- Root cause unknown (not AssetStatusBatch logic error)

### **Monitoring Instructions:**
```sql
-- Check asset status after overnight batch (run after 4:30 AM UTC)
SELECT Id, Name, Status, Start_Date__c, End_Date__c, LastModifiedDate, LastModifiedBy.Name 
FROM Asset 
WHERE Id = '02ifJ000000EKA9QAO'
```

### **Expected Result:**
- **Status:** Should remain "Purchased" (NO CHANGE)
- **LastModifiedDate:** Should NOT change from current value
- **Start_Date__c:** 2025-12-17 (should be unchanged)

### **Alert Conditions:**
- ‚ùå Status changes from "Purchased" to any other value
- ‚ùå Any modification during batch execution window
- ‚ùå Start_Date__c or End_Date__c values change

---

## üîç **BATCH MONITORING QUERIES**

### **1. Verify Batch Execution:**
```sql
-- Check batch jobs executed overnight
SELECT Id, Status, JobItemsProcessed, TotalJobItems, NumberOfErrors, CreatedDate, CompletedDate
FROM AsyncApexJob 
WHERE ApexClass.Name IN ('RevenueAutomationBatchManager', 'AssetStatusBatch', 'ContractRevenueBatch', 'AccountRollupBatch')
AND CreatedDate >= 2025-09-25T08:00:00.000+0000
ORDER BY CreatedDate ASC
```

### **2. Check Scheduled Job Status:**
```sql
-- Verify regular batch job is still active
SELECT Id, CronJobDetail.Name, State, NextFireTime, PreviousFireTime
FROM CronTrigger 
WHERE CronJobDetail.Name = 'RevenueAutomationBatchManager_Daily_Production'
```

### **3. Review Error Logs:**
```sql
-- Check for any batch execution errors
SELECT Id, Processing_Stage__c, Error_Message__c, CreatedDate, Contract_ID__c
FROM Batch_Execution_Log__c 
WHERE CreatedDate >= 2025-09-25T08:00:00.000+0000
AND (Contract_ID__c = '001fJ000021YBjKQAW' OR Contract_ID__c = '02ifJ000000EKA9QAO' OR Processing_Stage__c = 'FAILED')
ORDER BY CreatedDate DESC
```

## üö® **ESCALATION CRITERIA**

**Immediate Escalation Required If:**
1. ‚ùå Caris account does NOT update to "Active (Churning)" 
2. ‚ùå Almirall asset status changes from "Purchased"
3. ‚ùå Any batch job fails with errors
4. ‚ùå Scheduled job does not execute at expected time

**Investigation Steps If Issues Found:**
1. Capture exact timestamps and modification details
2. Check for system maintenance or resource constraints
3. Review debug logs from batch execution
4. Verify data integrity (no unexpected field changes)
5. Consider manual re-execution if safe to do so

---

## üìû **CONTACTS & CONTEXT**

**Session Log:** `/logs/session-2025-09-24-overnight-batch-investigation.md`  
**Investigation Notes:** Comprehensive testing performed - both records have confirmed working logic  
**Risk Level:** Medium - Monitoring for system stability, not critical business impact

**Previous Testing Results:**
- ‚úÖ Manual batch executions work correctly
- ‚úÖ Scheduled batch executions work correctly  
- ‚úÖ Business logic validation confirmed
- ‚úÖ Data relationships verified

**Expected Outcome:** Both records should behave normally, confirming September 23rd issues were anomalies.
