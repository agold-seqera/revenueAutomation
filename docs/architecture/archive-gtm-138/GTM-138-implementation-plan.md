# GTM-138 Implementation Plan

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** August 26, 2025  
**Project Status:** Setup Phase

## Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines the 5-phase implementation approach for the GTM-138 Exchange Rate Manager project.

## Phase 1: Field Architecture & Profile Setup

**Timeline:** Weeks 1-2  
**Jira Tickets:** GTM-184, GTM-183  
**Dependencies:** None

### P1.1 - Field Creation & Formula Fields (GTM-184)
- [ ] Create Exchange_Rate__c field on QuoteLineItem object (Number, 18,6)
- [ ] Create Exchange_Rate__c field on Asset object (Number, 18,6)
- [ ] Create 6 USD conversion formula fields on QuoteLineItem
- [ ] Create 8 USD conversion formula fields on Asset
- [ ] Create 10 USD rollup fields on Contract
- [ ] Create 5 USD conversion formula fields on Quote
- [ ] Enable field history tracking on all Exchange_Rate__c fields

### P1.2 - Profile & Security Configuration (GTM-183)
- [ ] Assign Exchange_Rate__c field permissions to all 9 profiles
- [ ] Keep Exchange_Rate__c fields hidden from all page layouts
- [ ] Verify inspector/CLI access for admin editing
- [ ] Test field-level security restrictions

**Deliverables:**
- 29 new USD conversion fields across 4 objects
- Field-level security configuration
- Field history tracking enabled
- Profile permissions assigned

## Phase 2: Exchange Rate Assignment Logic

**Timeline:** Weeks 3-4  
**Jira Tickets:** GTM-190, GTM-188, GTM-189, GTM-187  
**Dependencies:** Phase 1 complete

### P2.1 - QLI Rate Assignment (GTM-190, GTM-188)
- [ ] Enhance existing QLI creation logic to assign Exchange_Rate__c
- [ ] Integration testing with existing Quote creation process
- [ ] Validate rate inheritance from current exchange rates

### P2.2 - Asset Rate Assignment (GTM-189, GTM-187)
- [ ] Build Asset trigger to assign Exchange_Rate__c at creation
- [ ] Integration with Revenue Automation asset creation
- [ ] Test bulk Asset creation scenarios

**Deliverables:**
- Enhanced QuoteLineItem creation logic
- New Asset trigger for exchange rate assignment
- Integration with existing CPQ workflows

## Phase 3: Rollup Integration & Formula Validation

**Timeline:** Weeks 5-6  
**Jira Tickets:** GTM-189, GTM-185, GTM-191  
**Dependencies:** Phase 2 complete

### P3.1 - Daily Batch Flow Updates (GTM-189, GTM-185)
- [ ] Modify existing daily batch flow to use new Asset USD fields
- [ ] Update Contract rollup calculations for all USD fields
- [ ] Test mixed-currency rollup scenarios

### P3.2 - Formula Field Validation (GTM-191)
- [ ] Validate all 29 USD conversion formulas calculate correctly
- [ ] Test formula recalculation when Exchange_Rate__c is updated
- [ ] Performance testing for large datasets

**Deliverables:**
- Modified daily batch flow
- Validated formula field calculations
- Performance benchmarks

## Phase 4: Layout Updates & User Experience

**Timeline:** Weeks 7-8  
**Jira Tickets:** GTM-191, GTM-193, GTM-192  
**Dependencies:** Phase 3 complete

### P4.1 - Page Layout Configuration (GTM-191)
- [ ] Add USD conversion fields to relevant page layouts
- [ ] Configure field sections and ordering for optimal user experience
- [ ] Update related list views to include USD fields where appropriate

### P4.2 - Documentation & Testing (GTM-193, GTM-192)
- [ ] Document admin procedures for exchange rate corrections
- [ ] Create testing procedures for USD field calculations
- [ ] User acceptance testing with business stakeholders

**Deliverables:**
- Updated page layouts
- Admin documentation
- Testing procedures
- User training materials

## Phase 5: Enhancements (Non-Blocking)

**Timeline:** Weeks 9-10  
**Jira Tickets:** TBD  
**Dependencies:** Phase 4 complete

### P5.1 - Display & Formatting Improvements
- [ ] Corporate currency (USD) display with proper $ symbols
- [ ] Improved currency field formatting across objects
- [ ] Currency summary dashboards and reports

**Deliverables:**
- Enhanced currency formatting
- Executive dashboards
- Reporting improvements

## Risk Management

### Critical Path Dependencies
1. **Field Creation → Logic Implementation → Layout Updates**
2. **Profile Setup → Security Testing → User Training**
3. **Formula Validation → Batch Flow Updates → Production Deployment**

### Mitigation Strategies
- **ACM Preservation:** Maintain existing Opportunity functionality throughout
- **Performance Impact:** Test with large datasets before production deployment
- **Data Integrity:** Validate currency conversions in sandbox before go-live
- **User Experience:** Gradual rollout with extensive user training

## Success Criteria

### Phase Gates
- **Phase 1:** All fields created and profiles configured
- **Phase 2:** Exchange rate assignment working in all scenarios
- **Phase 3:** Formula fields calculating correctly, rollups functional
- **Phase 4:** User acceptance testing complete
- **Phase 5:** Enhancement features deployed

### Project Success Metrics
- ✅ Rate consistency across all revenue objects
- ✅ Accurate historical reporting
- ✅ Seamless CPQ integration
- ✅ Performance within acceptable limits
- ✅ User adoption and satisfaction
