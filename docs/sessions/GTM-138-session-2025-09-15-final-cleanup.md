# GTM-138 Exchange Rate Manager - Final Cleanup Session
**Date:** September 15, 2025  
**Phase:** Final Cleanup - Archive Old Flows and Delete Old Fields  
**Objective:** Archive old flow versions, delete old Currency USD fields, rename _New fields

## Flow Archive and Cleanup Analysis

### Current State Investigation

After retrieving all flows from the org and searching for references to old USD fields:

**Key Findings:**
1. **No flows found with old USD field references** - All local flows already use `_New__c` fields
2. **Contract flow in org** - Retrieved and confirmed it uses `ARR_USD_New__c`, `ACV_USD_New__c`, `TCV_USD_New__c`, `Active_ARR_USD_New__c`
3. **Account flow confirmed** - Local version uses `ARR_USD_New__c`, `ACV_USD_New__c`, `TCV_USD_New__c`, `Incremental_ARR_USD_New__c`
4. **Flow versions query returned 0 results** - Suggests either no old versions exist or they've been automatically cleaned up

### Flow Search Results
- Searched all 107 flows retrieved from org
- **0 files contain references to old USD__c fields**
- Pattern search for `ARR_USD__c|ACV_USD__c|TCV_USD__c|Active_ARR_USD__c|Incremental_ARR_USD__c|MRR_USD__c|Previous_Year_ARR_USD__c|Previous_Year_ACV_USD__c|Previous_Year_TCV_USD__c|Previous_Year_MRR_USD__c|AnnualRevenue_USD__c` found no matches

### Conclusion
**No flow archiving or deletion needed** - All flows already reference the correct `_New__c` fields.

The blocking issue for field deletion appears to be:
1. Lightning page references (manual UI cleanup required)  
2. Possibly old Lightning page layouts that still reference the old Currency fields

## Actual Results - Old Flow Versions Found

**CORRECTION**: Old flow versions DO exist and are blocking field deletion.

### Destructive Field Deletion Attempt Results:
- ❌ Failed to delete 19 USD Currency fields  
- ✅ Identified exact blocking flow versions
- ✅ Archived flow version details to `docs/archive/flow-versions/`

### Blocking Flow Versions Discovered:
**Contract Flow (6 obsolete versions):**
- `301O300001ACgoQ`, `301O300001ACnMr`, `301O300001AlA4I`, `301O300001AlEax`, `301O300001AlsgE`, `301O300001AltNs`

**Account Flow (4 obsolete versions):**  
- `301O300001ACqar`, `301O300001AQLTy`, `301O300001AR95r`, `301O300001ARWLh`

### Key Finding:
These correspond to versions 4,5,7,10,18,19,20,21,22,23 of the Contract and Account flows that must be manually deleted through the Salesforce UI.

## Manual Cleanup Required
**Cannot proceed programmatically** - user must manually delete these old flow versions in Salesforce Setup → Flows before USD field deletion can succeed.

## GTM-146 Integration Coordination (Sep 16, 2025)
✅ **INTEGRATION STATUS: COMPLETE & COMPATIBLE**

**Summary from GTM-146 Revenue Automation Project:**
- GTM-146 time-based revenue enhancements successfully implemented
- **Confirmed Compatibility:** All GTM-138 USD conversion formulas remain fully operational
- **No Conflicts:** Exchange rate logic unaffected by contract lifecycle enhancements  
- **Account Rollups:** Updated to use `Contract.ARR__c` (time-based) instead of `Contract.Active_ARR__c`
- **Contract Intelligence:** Now shows Initial values pre-activation, calculated values when active, preserved values when expired

**Technical Changes Made in GTM-146:**
- Modified `Contract.flow-meta.xml` with enhanced decision logic
- Modified `Scheduled_Flow_Daily_Update_Accounts.flow-meta.xml` field references
- All USD fields (`*_USD__c`) confirmed operational across all contract states

**Result:** Unified GTM-146 + GTM-138 system ready for coordinated production deployment!
